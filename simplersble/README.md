# SimpleRsBLE

The ultimate fully-fledged cross-platform library and bindings for
Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

## Overview

The SimpleBLE project aims to provide fully cross-platform BLE libraries
and bindings, designed for simplicity and ease of use with a licencing
scheme chosen to be friendly towards commercial use.
All specific operating system quirks are handled internally to provide a
consistent behavior across all platforms. The libraries also provide
first-class support for vendorization of all third-party dependencies,
allowing for easy integration into existing projects.
